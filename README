Author: Jordi Manyer Fuertes
Date : December 2019


REQUIREMENTS:
For the C code:
    - cmake 3.15 or newer
    - gcc
    - GSL (Gnu Scientific Library) correctly installed.
For the python scripts:
    - python3
    - py3 libraries: matplotlib, numpy, csv


USAGE:
- Compile using the CMake file CMakeLists.txt
- Run the code, the outputs will be created at cmake-build-debug/.out
- Run the python3 scripts to plot the results


CONTENT:
A) main.c     --> Main file, used to call all other subroutines.
                  Contains the main() function, and other routines specific to the different
                  assignments. The assignment routines should be called by main(), allowing
                  many specific assignments to be executed at the same time.

B) myHeader.h --> Main header, which declares all functions in /src and all the structures needed.

C) /src       --> Contains the rtbp library, written in c. The integration functions, located in
                  rtbp.c and rtbp_variationals.c are created using the package Taylor
                  (http://www.maia.ub.es/~angel/taylor/).

D) /Plotting  --> Contains python routines to produce the plots needed. They read the data from the
                  '.out' files created by the C routines.
